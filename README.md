# should_i_ask_her_out_game

My first real attempt at a flutter based application. It is a simple decision map based game about a boy who has a crush on a girl and is debating on whether or not to ask her out. The game has two options to choose from at all times and there are several potential outcomes. This game was made in my 2nd year of my computer science degree for my Programming Application and Programming Languages Module.

## Getting Started

This project was made intended to run on an android emulator/phone. In order to get started, first run pub get (easiest way to do this is to save the pubspec file as this will make it run automatically). Once this is done, open your android emulator and have it on standby. Open the lib folder and then open the main.dart file. In the main.dart file, click run and the application should run in the emulator. Once it loads you should be able to play the game.
